# Array of Things HTTP API

Welcome to the AoT API docs!

The Array of Things is an experimental urban sensing project. More information
about the project can be found at [arrayofthings.org](https://arrayofthings.org/).

## System Structure

AoT is deployed across several geographic areas. These deployment regions are
referred to as _Projects_. For example, our largest deployment is in the city
of Chicago so we have a project named `Chicago`.
