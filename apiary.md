# Array of Things HTTP API

Welcome to the Array of Things API docs!

The Array of Things is an experimental urban sensing project. More information
about the project can be found at [arrayofthings.org](https://arrayofthings.org/).

## System Structure

AoT is deployed across several geographic areas. These deployment regions are
referred to as **Projects**. For example, our largest deployment is in the city
of Chicago so we have a project named `Chicago`.

The physical devices being deployed are **Nodes**. Networks are comprised of Nodes.
Nodes are identified by their _VSN_ (a unique serial number we assign to each).

Onboard the Nodes are **Sensors**. Sensors observe various facets of the environment,
such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, particulant matter, and other
topics. It is important to note that there can be, and in some cases almost 
always is, redundancy in the types of information sensors record. It is important
to read the [sensor data sheets](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors/tree/master/sensors/datasheets)
provided by the Waggle team to determine differences.

The information recorded by Sensors are **Observations**. Observations are snapshots
of measurements at a given time on a given Node. It is important to note that some
Sensors are still not fully tuned or are in early stages of experimentation, and by
virtue of that their Observations may not have fully accurate data. To help disambiguate
these situations, the API also provides **Raw Observations** with both the raw value
of the observation and the _clean_ or _human readable_ value.

So, you can think of the hierarchy of system entities in the following sentence:

**Observations** are _recorded by_ **Sensors** that are _onboard_ **Nodes** that _organized within_ **Projects**.

## Entity Schemas

For each of the entities above, these are their schema details.

### Many to Many Relationships

There are obvious one to many relationships between nodes and raw/observations, and sensors and 
raw/observations. But there are also many to many relationships between projects, nodes and
sensors:

- Projects and Nodes share a relationship (it's how we calculate the bbox and hull for the project)
- Projects and Sensors share a relationship (sensors are onboard nodes and can be linked back)
- Nodes and Sensors share a relationship (via observations)

The obvious nature of the M2Ms between nodes and sensors and projects and sensors is intuitive.
However, we cannot guarantee that a node cannot be included in multiple projects. Let's say
for example that we had a special deployment of nodes to observe some small region within the city
of Chicago (where we already have an established project). We may decide that we want a logical
separation for this cluster of nodes in its own project, but by virtue of being in the same 
region as the Chicago project it would make sense to include those there. Hence the many to
many relationship.

## API Endpoints

The entire API is namespaced under the `/api` route. Each of the entities listed has its own
endpoint. There are many shared query parameters between them and each has a unique set
of parameters that can be optionally applied.

The corresponding endpoints are:

- Projects are listed at `/projects` and details are found at `/projects/:slug`
- Nodes are listed at `/nodes` and details are found at `/nodes/:vsn`
- Sensors are listed at `/sensors` and details are found at `/sensors/:path`
- Observations are listed at `/observations` (there is no detail path)
- Raw Observations are listed at `/raw-observations` (there is no detail path)

## Universal Query Params

The following table lists query parameters that can be applied to every endpoint.

| Parameter Key | Value Information                     | Example           | Details                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| order         | A direction and an attribute name     | `desc:timestamp`  | The ordering applied to the results; formatted as `asc|desc:{attribute}`; each endpoint provides a unique default |
| page          | A positive integer                    | `1` or `200`      | Used with the _size_ parameter to page through list endpoint results; default is `1`                              |
| size          | A positive integer not exceeding 5,00 | `20` or `1000`    | Used with the _page_ parameter to page through list endpoint results; default is `200`                            |

### Filtering Using the BBOX Param

Projects can be filtered using their `bbox` attribute. The filter must be 
constructed as `function:geojson` where _function_ is either **intersects**
or **contains**; _geojson_ must be a URL encoded GeoJSON object.

Here's an example of filtering projects who contain a specific point:

```
?bbox=contains:{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [12.234,-23.456],
    "crs": {
      "type": "name",
      "properties": {
        "name": "EPSG:4326"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here's an example of filtering project who intersect a polygon:

```
?bbox=intersects:{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[
      [1, 1],
      [1, 2],
      [2, 2],
      [2, 1],
      [1, 1]
    ]],
    "crs": {
      "type": "name",
      "properties": {
        "name": "EPSG:4326"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtering Using the LOCATION Param

Nodes can be filtered using their `location` attribute. There are two
forms this filter can take:

1. Finding nodes within a given geometry
2. Finding nodes within a given distance from a given point

#### Within a Geometry

For this option, the results are filtered to those that are within a
given geometry -- typically a Polygon. The parameter is formatted as:

```
?location=within:{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[
      [1, 1],
      [1, 2],
      [2, 2],
      [2, 1],
      [1, 1]
    ]],
    "crs": {
      "type": "name",
      "properties": {
        "name": "EPSG:4326"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Within Distance from Point

For this option, the results are filtered to those that are within
a given distance **in meters** from a given point. The parameter is
formatted as:

```
?location=within_distance:2000:{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [12.234,-23.456],
    "crs": {
      "type": "name",
      "properties": {
        "name": "EPSG:4326"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

or in shorthand: `within_distance:{{ distance in meters }}:{{ point }}`.

### Filtering Using Timestamps

For the `commissioned_on` and `decommissioned_on` attributes, you can
filter the values using simple arithmatic functions and a timestamp.
The timestamps must be ISO 8601 formatted with a `T` separating the
date and time sections: e.g. `2018-01-01T00:00:00`.

| Operator          | Symbol  | Parameter           |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| Less Than         | <       | `lt:{{ timestamp }}`  |
| Less or Equal     | <=      | `le:{{ timestamp }}`  |
| Equal             | ==      | `eq:{{ timestamp }}`  |
| Greater or Equal  | >=      | `ge:{{ timestamp }}`  |
| Greater Than      | >       | `gt:{{ timestamp }}`  |

## Observations Endpoint [/observations{?order,page,size,embed_node,embed_sensor,of_project,of_projects,from_node,from_nodes,by_sensor,by_sensors,location,timestamp,value,as_histogram,as_time_buckets}]

### Applying Aggregation

The observation values can be summarized and aggregated using a
special parameter format on the `value` key. The format must
follow the format `{{ func }}:{{ grouping field }}`.

Grouping fields:

- `node_vsn`
- `sensor_path`

Aggregate functions:

- `first` gets the latest observation
- `last` gets the oldest observation
- `count`, `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, `stddev`, `variance` and `percentile` all do exactly what the name implies

#### Caveats

`first` and `last` do not require passing a grouping field. You can use
them simply as `?value=first`.

`percentile` requires you pass an additional value specifying what percentile
you want calculated: `?value=percentile:0.5:node_vsn` for example.

### Filtering by Timestamp and Location

Filtering using the `timestamp` attribute adheres to the same rules
as the timestamp filters for nodes.

Filtering against the related node's location attribute is also possible
using the same filtering scheme listed for nodes.

## Raw Observations  [/raw-observations{?order,page,size,embed_node,embed_sensor,of_project,of_projects,from_node,from_nodes,by_sensor,by_sensors,location,timestamp,hrf,raw,aggregates,as_histogram,as_time_buckets}]

Raw observations have the exact same query parameters
as regular observations with the exception that you 
can filter by either `hrf` for the good value or `raw`
for the analog value. Also aggregating is split
into its own parameter -- it will compute the named
aggregate for both HRF and raw values.
